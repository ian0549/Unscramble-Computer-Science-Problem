------------------
Task 0: Worst case time-complexity is O(1)
The time-complexity for this program is O(1) 
becuase we are accessing the first and last value from the lists(calls and text)
and this doesn't change the runtime no matter the size of the input data

------------------
Task 1: Worst case time-complexity is O(n)
The time-complexity for this program is O(n) 
becuase each input data (n) in the texts and call record is being accessed and that the runtime increases  linearly  with the number of input data(n) 

------------------
Task 2: Worst case time-complexity is O(n)
The time-complexity for this program is O(n) 
becuase the runtime increases  linearly  with the number of input data(n).
We are accessing all data (n) in the calls record.


------------------
Task 3: Worst case time-complexity is O(n log n)
The time complexity is O(n log n) becuase for every value of O(n) in the calls record (n) , a logarithm time complexity is operated
We are performing a sorting algorithm for every input value in O(n)

------------------
Task 4:Worst case time-complexity is O(n log n)
The time complexity is O(n log n) becuase for every value of O(n) in the texts and calls records, a logarithm time complexity is operated
We are performing a sorting algorithm for every input value in O(n)
